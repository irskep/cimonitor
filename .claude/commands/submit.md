   ```

   Avoid unnecessary lists in your commit message. Avoid adding filler to lists to make them longer.
5. `git push -u origin HEAD`
6. Create a PR:

   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "[PR Title]" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   <message>

   EOF
   )"
   ```

   Avoid unnecessary lists in the PR description. PR descriptions do not have a minimum length, just do what's appropriate. Adding fluff and over-emphasizing minor points makes you seem less intelligent.
7. Monitor CI with `uv run cimonitor watch --pr=<pr-number>`
